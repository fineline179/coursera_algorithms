#+TITLE: Coursera Algorithms: Course 2
#+STARTUP: showall latexpreview inlineimages

* TODOs
- [X] C2W2 quiz
- [X] C2 final
- [ ] Implement Dijkstra's Alg using Heap
- [ ] Update algoReview.org with coursera course's version of HEAP-INSERT and EXTRACT-MAX (where HEAP-INSERT uses a BUBBLE-UP function, and EXTRACT-MAX uses a BUBBLE-DOWN). Clean up Heap section of algoReview.org to good synthesis of stuff in Cormen and coursera course.
- [X] Scan my quiz work and put images of pages in w1-w4 dirs
